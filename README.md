# Snake Game

Simple web-based Snake game. Open `index.html` in a browser to play. Use arrow keys to steer the snake and collect items. The game begins with five items on the board and periodically adds more when only three remain, up to a maximum of eight at once. Each item is worth 10 points and extends the snake by one tile. The board is 35x35 tiles and the snake moves every 0.2 seconds. If the snake is stuck against a wall or itself for more than one second, the game ends.
